# ProjektyCpp
This repository contains C++ Projects, theoretical examples and Codility excercises. 

In directory Project you can find three projects that I have written during classes at PWr.

Directory Nauka contains some example code, from which it is possible to learn about topics such as for ex. SOLID, move smeantics or smart pointers.

Directory Zadania contains all 46 codility excercises. Almost all of them have scored 100%, and only two of them recived slightly lower score.
